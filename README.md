# Martha Stewarts Video Game Bible

https://teknix420.github.io/Martha-Stewarts-VG-Bible/index.html

This is a web based application made using HTML 5, Materialize, and Javascript/jQuery. The website uses the IGDB and Tasty API's to find information on searched/random video game titles and will pair the results up with a random food recipe for the user to try.

## The Home Screen

The home page consists of two sections. The first section will present the user with an area to search any video game they can think of. The information for that game will be pulled and displayed using the IGDB API and the user will be presented with the information on all titles containing the game name and will be presented with a random recipe from the Tasty API at the bottom of the screen.

## Finding a Random Video Game

The second section of the home screen will present the user with certain criteria to fill out. Depending on what the user inputs, a random arrangement of video games will be presented to the user that match the preferences selected.

The same information for the video games that was presented in the search will be presented for the random video games.

The user will also be given a random recipe from Tasty's API as well.
